#### Version 2.0

###### OAuth Intergration
The Plaid API has additional security requirements to allow users to connect their actual bank accounts. I want to get approval so I can utilize Plaid's Link Page.

###### Formatting/Styling
I want to fix minor styling issues on Easy Money as well as increase the accessibility of the website in a future version. 

###### Testing
I would like to incorporate more unit testing using PyTest ad I continue to develop the application.
